Real Estate 2020 is a 40-page report created by PWC real estate division. It is intended for anyone interested in real estate trends across the globe. I came across this pdf while I was reading megatrends in real estate. Page number 13 has 3 graphs that talk about looking at the projections in population shifts happening around the world and is it significant enough to impact demand in real estate. For this assignment I have focused on figures 6 & 7 as the visualization in figure 6 is still understandable but it becomes confusing due to the use of a very similar color set and I was not able to differentiate between Mexico, USA and World. Figure 7 on the other hand I feel is manipulating information to put the focus on the fact that the population above 60 years is increasing, though it conveys the information to the audience but is not truthful to the actual interpretation of the data.
